We are sorry to inform you that the transmission ended here. It appears that our extraterrestrial visitors completed their upload of their investigation of the differences between tri-parental and bi-parental mating systems and were beginning to transmit a data dump of core innovations of their culture, from their technology to the scientific knowledge and metaphysics. Unfortunately, this portion of their transmission did not arrive intact.

We have taken all of the data sent to us by our alien visitors and formatted it to the best of our ability. Extant errors within the text may be due to translation errors by the aliens, differences in logical thinking in alien cognition, or possibly transmission errors that we were not able to correct. Despite its imperfect nature, we think that it contributes valuable information, which we would like to share with the rest of the world.

We hope you enjoyed this interplanetary transmission.
