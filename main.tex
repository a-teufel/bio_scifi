\chapter*{The Evolution and Consequences of Tri-parental Systems}


\textit{This is a work of speculative science, any resemblance to any civilization is coincidental.}
\vspace{12pt}


Upon examination of your literature we have determined that most organisms on Earth subscribe to a bi-parental system. In this paper, we would like to explain the emergence of tri-parentalism and its consequences. First, we explain in what conditions a tri-parental world might emerge, and when would it include three different mating types (subgroups of individuals in a species, where individuals in one subgroup preferentially mate with those in other subgroups). Second, we describe the genetics of our species which enable tri-parentalism. Third, we give examples of species with a tri-parental system. Fourth, we discuss some implications of this tri-parental system on disease dynamics and family health. Fifth, we investigate how our monoculture might have been a consequence from our tri-parental system. Finally, we investigate the implication for costly signaling, the origin of the biochemistry of our life form, the emergence of monogamous tri-parental marriages, and the meaning of life.

Both our home planet and Earth have evolved sexual reproduction, such that the production of offspring requires more than one parent. Although there are potential costs of sex (\emph{e.g.}, a ``two-fold cost of males'' for many Earth species \cite{smith2017origin,smith1978evolution}, increase in disease spread, increased coordination and search costs, see later sections), the ubiquity of sex also implies strong benefits. One theoretical model \cite{kondrashov_selection_1982} demonstrated that sex can dilute the number of deleterious mutations in a genome, while asexual organisms monotonically increase their mutational load. This can favor the evolution of sex. 

But how many individuals should combine their genetic material to produce an offspring? On Earth, the overwhelmingly dominant mode is two parents (although there are a very small number of exceptions; \cite{cohen2013biological,bloomfield2019triparental}). On our home star system, three parents is the mode. We discuss in the next section how three parents could combine genetic material to produce an offspring. 

In addition to the number of parents, species may differ in the number of mating types. Mating types are subdivisions of a population where individuals of one mating type preferentially mate with individuals of one or more different mating types. For humans, there exist two mating types (\emph{i.e.}, males and females) but for other organisms on Earth, such as fungi and slime molds, there can be many more mating types \cite{collins1977new}. Our own species happens to have three mating types. The existence of mating types implies the ability to avoid mating with one's own type (self-avoidance). This may be beneficial because it can increase the genetic diversity of offspring, but may also entail search costs and prevent an individual from mating with otherwise suitable mates \cite{bull_combinatorics_1989,iwasa_evolution_1987}. 

We asked what ecological differences between our home star system and the planet Earth could have driven the evolution of different numbers of parents, self-avoidance, and different numbers of mating types. We used the model developed by Kondrashov \cite{kondrashov_selection_1982} and extended by Perry \cite{perry2017sex} to examine the role of mutation rate, encounter rate, and the coordination cost of $n$-parental systems on the emergence of stable bi- and tri-parental systems.


\subsection*{Model of emergence of tri-parental systems} 
For you to understand the origin of our triparental system, it is first helpful to consider the benefit of sexual reproduction in general. It has been observed that a major problem is that with asexual reproduction, deleterious mutations can continuously accumulate. This occurs because it is more likely that an asexual offspring acquires an additional mutation, instead of removing a previously acquired one [Cite Muller]. Among other other advantages~cite{kondrashov1993classification}, sexual reproduction can dramatically increase the variability found among offspring, including variability in the number of deleterious mutations: some offspring will have many more mutations than their parents, and some will have many fewer. Natural selection can then use this variability to favor offspring with few mutations, maintaining in check the overall level of mutations in the population.

Based on these observations, Earth-based scientists created a simple model that explains the benefit of biparental sex in terms of removing deleterious mutations~\cite{kondrashov_selection_1982,kondrashov_deleterious_1988}. Recently, however, researchers realized that triparental reproduction can be even more effective at removing deleterious mutations, and (absent other assumptions) in fact has advantages over biparental reproduction~\cite{perry_why_2017}. As we will see, this ability to very effectively remove deleterious mutations is why triparentalism became dominant in our world.

Importantly, these models~\cite{perry_why_2017,kondrashov_selection_1982} explained the benefit of sexual reproduction without considering what role, if any, may be played by the presence of different mating types (whether symmetric or asymmetric). At the same time, the benefit of sex obviously occurs only when the parents are not genetic clones (otherwise sexual reproduction becomes equivalent to asexual reproduction). In the models of~\cite{perry_why_2017,kondrashov_selection_1982}, however, it is always assumed that parents are not clones of each other. 

This is not adequate for explaining our world. When sexual reproduction originated on our planet, it required only the presence of any three parents, which were not differentiated into mating types (i.e., any organism could in principle mate with any two other ones). The three parents would deposit a large number of gametes into the same pool. In this pool, triplets of gametes would then come together and sexually fuse, thereby forming new organisms. In many cases, however, this scheme did not lead to the full benefits of sex, because the three gametes that would fuse would not always originate from three different parent organisms. In fact, when three organisms contribute gametes to a common pool, there is only a 2/9 probability that a randomly chosen triple of gametes will represent all three parents. Thus, in our original system, sexual reproduction would often invovle the mixing together of clones, in this way loosing some of the advantages of sex (and also violating the assumptions of the aforementioned models~\cite{perry_why_2017,kondrashov_selection_1982}).

To develop self-avoidance —- that is, to not allow sexual reproduction between clones — our life-forms developed a system in which organisms are differentiated into 3 different mating types (which, at this point, were still phenotypically symmetric). A mating event between three parents could only happen if the three parents belonged to three different mating types. Moreover, gamete triplets that came together would only initiate sexual fusion when three different mating types were represented in a triplet. This guaranteed that gametes from the same parent (which would be clones) could never join together. This is the origin of triparental reproduction on our planet, as well as the origin of our three self-avoiding mating types. The asymmetry in the gametes of these three mating types followed later, and is described in more detail below.

The mating scheme described above guarantees self-avoidance, but it is not without some possible disadvantages. In particular, under this system, not all possible parent triplets can mate, but only those triplets that contain all three different mating types. There is only a 2/9ths probability that three parents chosen from a population will contain all three mating types. If a self-avoiding parent only has a single chance to find a set of mating partners, this cost is enormous. However, if such a parent has many possibilities to find a set of compatible mating partners in a given mating period, then this cost decreases (in particular, the probability that an acceptable triplet is found after $n$ attempts is $(1-(2/9))^n$). This can be represented in terms of a \emph{coordination cost}, which is equal to $1/n$.  Coordination cost is the portion of an organism’s mating period that is required to find one possible set of mating partners. It approaches 0 when an infinite number of possible triplets can be attempted in a given mating period (in which case, an acceptable set of mating partners will always be found), and 1 when only a single possible mating triplet can be attempted.

There are many different mating systems possible. The number of parents can be 1 (asexuality), 2 (biparentalism), 3 (triparentalism), or even larger ($n$-parentalism). There can also be different systems of mating types. Furthermore, different mating systems can carry different kinds of costs, such as the coordination cost that define our self-avoidance scheme. Using a simple extension of the models mentioned above~\cite{perry_why_2017,kondrashov_selection_1982}, we show that different kinds of mating systems are favored under different conditions (these results are summarized in \cref{fig:heatmapartemy}). In particular, across the parameters considered by our analysis, there is a sequence of optimal schemes going from (1) a triparental system with no mating types to (2) a biparental system with self-avoiding mating types to (3) a triparental system with self-avoiding mating types (our system). Generally, system (1) is favored when coordination costs are high and/or when mutations rates are low, and system (3) is favored when coordination costs are low and mutations rates are higher. In transitions from (1) to (3) there is always a region in which a self-avoiding biparental system becomes optimal. Note that $n$-parentalism for $n>3$, either with or without self-avoiding mating types, can also be favored, though for simplicity we do not analyze its dynamics here. 

\subsection*{Mutation and coordination in finite populations}
The above model assumes an infinite population and is limited to species with asexual, bi-, or tri-parental reproduction. This leaves a number of question unanswered. For one, does tri-parental reproduction dominate all $n$-parental reproductive strategies, or is it dominated under some circumstances by reproductive strategies with more parents? Moreover, the above model assumes infinite populations. Is this assumption critical to its results?

To address these questions, we implemented Kondrashov's model of deleterious mutations as an agent-based model. Each population consisted of a finite number of organisms who reproduced either bi-, tri-, or quadri-parentally, defined as the number of gametes that are required to produce an offspring. 

Species could also engage in self-avoidance, such that any individual could only contribute one gamete to an $n$-parental offspring. Said otherwise, in a self-avoiding $n$-parental species, all $n$ gametes must come from $n$ unique individuals. In the absence of self-avoidance, for example, offspring in a $3$-parental species could be produced from the gametes of only two individuals, with one parent supplying two gametes (i.e., a kind of hybrid sexual-asexual reproduction). In concrete terms, one might imagine a well-mixed urn into which $n$ parents had contributed an arbitrarily large but equal number of gametes. In the absence of self-avoidance, any $n$ gametes could be drawn at random from the urn to create an offspring. With self-avoidance, gametes from $n$ unique individuals would need to be drawn from the urn to create a viable offspring. If repeatedly drawing gametes from the urn is costly, then self-avoidance would incur a `coordination' cost, which would increase monotonically with the number of self-avoidant parents involved in reproduction.

In this model, a 3-parental mating strategy once again dominated the 2-parental strategy. But the 4-parental strategy dominated the 3-dominated strategy, the 5-parental strategy dominated the 4-parental strategy, and so on. This monotonic dominance hierarchy, however, was disrupted by the cost associated with finding gametes from $n$ unique individuals. Indeed, under reasonable assumptions about the cost of coordinating the gametes of $n$ unique parents, tri-parentalism actually dominated both bi-parentalism and quadri-parentalism (and thus all forms of $n$-parentalism with $n>3$). 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{TylerFigures/tyler72plot.pdf}
    \caption{Relative success of $n$-parental reproductive strategies, with and without coordination costs. Dashed horizontal lines demarcate the coordination costs in which 3-parentalism dominates other $n$-parental reproductive strategies.}
    \label{fig:tylerModel}
\end{figure}

Thus, in finite populations of self-avoiding organisms in which there are costs associated with coordinating the reproduction of $n$ unique organisms, there is a sweet spot where the benefits of combining the genetic material of $n$ unique parents outweighs the cost of coordinating the combination of those parents. Under reasonable assumptions, the optimal value of $n$ is 3. It is possible that the Earth's unusual combination of low mutation rates and high coordination costs could have created an environment for bi-parentalism to thrive, despite its obvious shortcomings.

\subsection*{The evolution of self-avoiding mating types in sexually reproducing species}


While we can establish that there are cases where self-avoiding mating types outperform a system where any three (or two) individuals can reproduce, it is less clear how self-avoiding mating types might initially emerge in a sexually reproducing population. Although this remains an open question, a negative result in our own scientific literature provides an intriguing lead in this direction. This study used an agent based model to simulate a spatially structured population of individuals depositing gametes into a local pool. Similarly to the mathematical model above, each gamete contains a single chromosome, represented by a string specifying whether each site contains a wild type allele or a deleterious mutation. When three gametes combine to form a new individual, each site has a small probability of a new mutation. All mutations are assumed to be double-recessive i.e. only expressed if zero wild type alleles are present. As above, an individual’s probability of survival decreases with number of expressed mutations. 

At each time step, each individual deposits gametes locally, moves with fixed probability, and dies with fixed probability. Gametes, which are assumed to mix on a smaller spatial scale than individuals, also have a fixed probability to be removed from the pool at each time step. New births occur up to local carrying capacity, using sets of gametes selected uniformly at random from the pool.

Each individual’s gametes are tagged by a type, chosen uniformly from the types of the parental gametes with a small chance of mutation to a novel type. The probability of a gamete rejecting a proposed match in favor of remaining in the pool is a heritable quantity between zero (not self-avoiding) and one (completely self-avoiding), copied from the same parent as the gamete type, and also subject to small mutations. In the initial population, all individuals have no deleterious mutations, are of identical type, and are non-self-avoiding.

Within what the authors acknowledged was a relatively narrow range of parameters, the mutational costs of self-fertilization did not appear to be a strong enough pressure to drive the evolution of self-avoiding mating types. However the authors did mention in passing that, in the course of debugging their model, it seemed like multiple mating types were established and maintained with increasing self-avoidance over time in a (at the time considered to be unrealistic) two-parent, diploid system. Due to our current distance from our home planet, communications will not reach the corresponding author until after our window of communication with earth has closed, but further explorations on this topic would be a rich avenue for future study.


\section*{The genetics of a tri-parental species} 

In this section, we will focus on explaining our genetics and how it compares to the genetics of your species. The details of the origin of the biochemistry of our life form, as well as the precise chemistry that forms it, will be discussed in a later section. For this reason we will refer to our genetic material as sets of double stranded chromosomes when necessary so that you are able to understand the analogy. The main distinction however, is that unlike your diploid genomes, where you inherit one copy of each chromosome from one of your two parents, our genome is triploid, where we inherit one copy of each chromosome from one of our three parents. In both our systems we have gametes: cells used during sexual reproduction to produce a new organism (\emph{e.g.}, sperm or egg in Figure \ref{fig:2}). The details of the recombination events occurring pre-gamete formation are discussed in the `genetics' section of the Supplementary Materials and an overview is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cross3}.

The dynamics of our genetics and how it affects assignment of mating types is surprisingly analogous to yours but with some key differences which will be expanded upon in the SI. As discussed previously, our species is composed of three mating types. These mating types are distinguished by three sex-determining genotypes: `XXY', `XYY' and `XYZ'.
% the quote marks look weird when compiled and i don't know how to do that
Each of these mating types produce haploid gametes, and all three gametes need to come together in order to produce a triploid off-spring. Each parent thus contributes a third of its genetic material to the offspring and conversely the offpring's genome is composed of a third of each of its parents genome.

The XYZ mating type produces the largest gamete, that is then fertilized by the other two smaller ones. In your species, you would thus define XYZ as female and the other two as different types of males, although it is important to note that this analogy does not quite match with our genders. The main difference to note is that the two `male' mating-types each produce only one type of gamete. The XXY genotype only produces X gametes while the XYY genotype only produces Y gametes. It follows that the female, producing all three X, Y and Z gametes, is the one that biologically determines the mating type of the offspring. We have included an example of the "Punnet square" that describes sex determination in the case of two types (Table \ref{tab:punnet_human}) and its extension to illustrate this concept in our species with (Table \ref{tab:punnet_us}). In the next section, we discuss models for the emergence of these asymmetrical gametes (when gametes evolve different size characteristics).

    \label{fig:gameteSize2Panel}
\end{figure}
The natural history of Earth and our planet differ in many, but not all, respects. Notably, on both Earth and our planet mating types preceded gamete asymmetry. The preceding sections describe the evolution of tri-parental inheritance, mating types, self-avoidance, and genetics in the high radiation environment of our planet. In this section we discuss the evolution of gamete asymmetry, then in the next section link these ideas to the natural history and evolutionary ecology of the species on our planet. These ideas will continue to be pertinent in the sections on society.

As on Earth, there is great diversity in mating systems corresponding with great diversity in fertilization strategies. Nevertheless, the modal mating system has three self-avoiding sexes. Furthermore, the most common pattern for gamete sizes on our planet, as described above, is for two sexes to produce gametes near the minimum viable size, while one sex produces much larger gametes. However, an important minority of species have one sex that produces gametes near the minimum viable size, and two sexes that produce larger gametes. Since on Earth sexes with small gametes are usually called male and those with large gametes female, it is perhaps tempting to associate all small gamete sexes with male and large with female. This is probably useful, but certainly masks a great deal of nuance, especially since our social scientists also make a similar distinction as yours between sex and gender.

To make these ideas concrete, we present both a dynamic and static model of the evolution of gamete asymmetry, both of which take three self-avoiding mating types with distinct gametes as given. These are both described in full detail in the SI. The dynamical model assumes a coupled system of multiple sexes evolving together. The model assumes that the gamete sizes of all sexes evolve via natural selection to increase the number of off-spring that individuals have. The number of off-spring depends on two components. The first is competition with members of own-sex, where the chance of one's own gamete successfully merging with that of one's mate(s) increases with the number of gametes produced; however, there is a trade-off in the total energy used for gamete production, so that producing more gametes comes at the cost of lower gamete size. The second component is cooperation with other sexes, where the chance of the off-springs being born successfully increases with the size of the two merged gametes. We perform an agent-based simulation for this model, and the results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gameteSize2Panel}. To convince you of the model's validity, we show that the two-sex case of the model recovers what we observe is typical for Earth --- one sex evolves to have a large gamete size, and the other evolves to have the minimal gamete size. In the three-sex version of the model, we show that one sex evolves to have a large gamete size, and the other two evolve to have the minimal viable gamete size. 

The second model reaches an almost identical conclusion, albeit with different theoretical machinery. In particular, we assess the evolutionary stability of tri-parental inheritance with three mating types for which each mating type has exactly one distinct gamete. For the Flying-Flower species discussed in more detail below, we provide conditions so that it is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for two species to adopt a minimum viable gamete size, and one to adopt a large gamete size. That is, the minimal gamete size of two sexes are found to be a corner solution of the optimality condition and mutating them to a larger size would not improve their fitness. When the two sexes exhibit minimal gamete sizes, the large gamete size of the other sex is also evolutionarily stable. These conditions have to do with the probability of double matings. So long as these probabilities are even slightly above zero, the ESS exists. With slight modifications, this model works for most species on our planet (including us), though as we point out above there are species with sufficiently unique mating systems such that other ESSs exist.

\section*{Some illustrating examples from the natural history of our planet}
%\section*{The evolutionary ecology and sociobiology of tri-parentalism}
As on your world, gamete asymmetry has had far-reaching consequences on the subsequent development of species that evolved it. This is easiest understood by loosely associating sexes having small gametes with Earth males and sexes having big gametes with Earth females, though, as pointed out above, much nuance is lost by making analogies with Earth sexes. To summarize core, relevant points made above: (1) the most common gamete pattern on our planet is small/small/large and (2) amongst sexually reproducing species the ancestral (and most common) mating mechanism involves three sexes coming together at one place to fertilize an egg with three gametes. Our species follows both of these dominant patterns: small/small/large gametes and three-sex mating events. We do discuss, below, an interesting case of a species that does not follow the three-sex mating event pattern.

It is common on our planet for ``males'' of a species to evolve flashy displays as the result of sexual selection. Similarly, males of some species maintain harems and thus have evolved substantial physical dimorphism. One phenomenon that some species on our planet exhibit, that could not emerge on your planet, is frequent cooperation in seeking mates between individuals of the ``male 1'' sex and ``male 2'' sex. This is possible because these males are not competing directly with each other for genetic heritage, but do share a common interest in reproducing with ``females.'' It is common in such species that males of one sex are relatively small but specialize in costly display (see the section below on costly signaling) whereas males of the other sex are drab (both physically and behaviorally) but grow large or otherwise evolve exceptional physical characteristics, such as great agility or stamina. Clearly, the consequences of tri-parental inheritance and gamete asymmetry are sufficiently far-reaching that we cannot address all of those consequences here. In lieu of that, we unpack one particular case study in greater detail: the Flying-Flower genus (this our best attempt at a literal translation of our name for this set of species).

In Earth idiom, Flying-Flower species are a textbook example in our world. Indeed, they are taught formally to the juveniles of our species as a touchstone example in biology and ecology. For this reason, it is the mating system analyzed in the SI and discussed in the preceding section. Flying-Flower species follow the more common gamete pattern of our planet (small/small/large), but do not follow the more common pattern of simultaneous three-sex mating events. What is perhaps most notable about Flying-Flower species is that the three sexes have very different physical structures and behaviors. The so-called Flower sex ($F$) is sessile and, like plants on Earth, photosynthesizes. The other two species are the Pollinator ($P$) and Central species ($C)$. The Pollinator transfers genetic material from $F$ to $C$, but unlike with Earth pollinators, who typically receive a food reward such as nectar, its ``reward'' is that it mixes in its genetic material with the genetic material of $F$. For much of our history, our scientists assumed that the three sexes of species in the Flying-Flowers clade were distinct species because of their great physical and behavioral differences. It was a watershed moment when our scientists realized that, in fact, they consist of members of the same species. Indeed, this insight led three of our scientists to independently and near-simultaneously discover the principle of natural selection, much as Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace co-discovered natural selection at nearly the same time in your world.

Individuals of the sessile $F$ sex compete for the attention of the pollinating $P$ sex by creating flashy, decorative bundles containing their genetic material. The pollinators, $P$, do not need to engage in costly display because the more fit individuals are more adapt at gathering the best bundles. Thus, their ability to gather high quality display bundles is a direct, honest reflection of their quality. The pollinators add their own genetic material to their display bundle, then display it to individuals of the central sex, $C$, who choose which bundle to accept and use for reproduction. It is rare for either $F$ or $P$ individuals to engage in substantial parental investment. As a closing note for this case study, we have observed a similar phenomenon among Flying-Flower species (and other species on our planet) to what you call the Trivers-Willard hypothesis: high quality members of the $C$ sex will invest greater parental effort in the sex or sexes with the higher variance fitness outcomes ($F$ and/or $P$), whereas low quality $C$ individuals will invest greater parental effort in the lower variance sex or sexes.
%but for our most common gamete pattern (two small, one large) one is well-served by associating the small gamete sexes with Earth males and the large gamete species with Earth females. In Earth terminology this would be called a text-book example since 

%(a core topic in your field called evolutionary ecology), and the tri-parental inheritance system clearly  kin-selection in ways that are laid out below

%Like the Flying-Flowers, our species has two sexes with small gametes and one with large. However, unlike with the Flying-Flowers, mating occurs as one event among three individuals of each sex, not via two distinct mating events that occur between two sexes ($F$-$P$ and $P$-$C$).

\section*{The implications of tri-parentalism for society}

We review a few implications that a tri-parent system would have on greater social structures. We believe there are many consequences beyond this paper, but concentrated on two different, interrelated outcomes:\ marriage rates, and the presence/absence of cultural diversity.

\subsection*{Matching model: marriages and divorce}

Marriages have emerged across cultures as recognized unions between two or more individuals \cite{Fortunato2015}. While marriage does not require or assume reproduction, it does often involve restrictions on sexual relations and investments in children. On earth, there are usually three configurations: 1) monogamous marriages (a person only has one spouse at a given time), 2) polyandry (a female has multiple male spouses at any given time), and 3) polygyny (a male has multiple female spouses). While polygyny (a male with multiple female spouses) is historically the default human marriage system, monogamy has emerged in situations where more control of inheritance is needed \cite{Fortunato2015, Fortunato2009}. 

Our society does share marriage as an institution, and tri-person monogamous marriages have become the norm. However, the difference in the number of sexes to be matched seems to have resulted in salient differences between our institution and yours. From what we observed in your fictional stories, it seems that your marriage is very stable, or at least aims to be so. In your ``movies'' and ``drama series'', we have observed that couples frequently declares ``eternal love'' and they decide to ``live happily ever after''. 

Our system of marriage does not work that way. Marriages among our species are typically much more short-lived than marriages among humans on Earth, and most parties to a marriage do not anticipate that it will last for the remainder of their lifetime. Our people repeat getting married, getting divorced, searching for better mates, getting married, etc. This difference is explained by the difficulty of finding the optimal mates in our tri-parental system. Imagine we have a population consisting of $N$ individuals of each mating type. In a bi-parental system, you only need to find a ``soulmate'' from $N$ members of the opposite sex (or, somewhat less commonly, of the same sex), which is ridiculously easy in our ``eyes.'' For us, the perfect match is a ``soul-triplet'' and we each have to find it out of $N^2$ combinations if we are to marry, to use paraphrase your idiom, ``'til  death do the three of us part''. Sadly, this happens only exceedingly rarely.

Figure~\ref{fig:married_rate} demonstrates this point via a simple model. In this model, people from each mating type randomly meet, and form a marriage so long as the marriage improves the pair's/triple's current situation. If we repeat this process infinitely, it should converge to a stable equilibrium. As you can see, the marriage rate at a given time from the start of the model run decreases with more sex types, and the average utility tends to be lower as a result.

    \caption{The ratio of married population and the average utility.}
    \label{fig:married_rate}
\end{figure}

Note that this model only illustrates the comparative difficulty of finding a mate in marriage systems with different numbers of partners. In reality, we have excellent meeting technology (i.e., dating platforms) tailored to our three-part institution of marriage to facilitate finding a better partner; this makes meeting easier, but does little to change the high divorce rates that typify our species.

Also, marriage in our system is actually slightly more stable than this simple model, due to the desire to avoid paying the search cost in looking for a new triple, and the due to the demands of parental care. However, the fact that achieving a sustainable marriage has low probability has had crucial consequences in our society, particularly with regard to cultural homo/heterogeneity, which we discuss in the following section.

To note, on Earth, there is little evidence that polygyny is harmful for individuals \cite{Mulder1990, Sear2002, Lawson13827}. In societies where monogamy and polygyny occur, polygynous groups seem to lead to greater child and woman health and security \cite{Mulder1990}. Generally speaking, polygynous households are correlated with greater wealth; whether on earth this is due to the fact that wealthier men can have more wives, or those with more wives can aggrandize, is unclear. However, the ``polygyny-threshold model'' suggests that polygyny will develop when costs associated with sharing a husband can be offset by resource accumulation that would be difficult under monogamy \cite{Lawson13827}. What is clear from these studies is that \textit{there is little evidence} that a three- or more-parent group would lead to a decrease in child, mother, or father health \cite{Lawson13827, Mulder1990}. Rather, it seems that evidence points to higher health indices for each individual in this type of family on your own planet.

\subsection*{Cultural mixing under tri-parental reproduction}
The Voyager data, as well as other data that we have uploaded from Earth during our fly-by, strongly suggests that contemporary Earth society is still highly divided into different cultures. This strikes us as surprising; when our society reached Earth's current level of capability for inter-cultural mixing, a homogeneous quickly emerged. In light of the salience of two-parent reproduction in our study of Earth, we chose to investigate whether our own capacity for $3$-parent reproduction can explain, at least in part, the emergence of cultural homogeneity in our society, as compared to the Earthling's highly diverse and stratified system of cultures.\par 

Our model (provided in the SI) shows that under 3-parent reproduction, the average number of cultural affinities that a person can expect to have over the course of their lifetime increases rapidly throughout the generations. At some point, the cognitive load of maintaining multiple cultural identities becomes overwhelming, even for beings like us. We hypothesize that our current cultural homogeneity emerged as a response to the explosion in cultural identities modelled above. This is due to three factors:\ our aforementioned lower rate of people who are never married, the greater possibility for acquiring additional cultural affinities through marriage, and the fact that under 3-parent reproduction, the average number of cultural affinities that a person is born with increases rapidly through the generations. Indeed, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:cultureplot}, our model is consistent with an outcome in which the average person's expected lifetime cultural affinities increases rapidly with their marriage-independent cultural affinities.\par 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{culture1.png}
    \caption{As the mean number of cultural affinities that a person acquires outside of marriage increases, the number of cultural affinities that the average person can expect to acquire over their lifetime also increases.}
    \label{fig:cultureplot}
\end{figure}


Certainly, the evidence from Earth suggests that there is a critical level of cultural complexity at which individuals become overburdened and the adoption of a single culture becomes necessary. In an ethnographic study of a highly multilingual after-school program in Los Angeles, \cite{orellana2016cultivating} find that despite speaking a wide array of languages and dialects at home, children in the program converged on a narrower range of English and Spanish dialects when speaking with each other. Data from \cite{rumbaut2013immigration} show that while the United States is historically a country with a high rate of immigration and therefore a rich diversity of language forms, is also a ``language graveyard'', i.e.\ a country where immigrant languages increasingly fall out of use. These findings suggest that there is a level of linguistic diversity at which languages start to fall out of use, due to the need for assimilation. There is some evidence that this is due not just to the desire for assimilation into the dominant community, but also due to the cognitive load of speaking multiple languages. \cite{matras2000fusion}
finds that speakers of multiple languages often develop strategies for ``fusing'' their spoken languages in to one common language, so that the multilingual subject effectively speaks a single, fused language. This fusion develops as a shortcut for avoiding the cognitive load associated with maintaining fluency in two completely different languages.\par 





Language is, of course, only one aspect of culture, and the cultural homogeneity of our current society encompasses more dimensions of culture than language. Indeed, most people in our society speak a common language (aside from our solitary "Turkish" speaker in our voyaging group), but we also share a broader set of common cultural practices. We suspect, however, that the emergence of such cultural homogeneity began with the fusing of language, which led to a broader fusion of cultural elements communicated via a common media. We also have strong evidence that this process of cultural convergence developed at a much faster rate in our society than the rate at which it is currently developing on Earth. In light of the model proposed above, we have reason to suspect that our $3$-participant system of marriage and reproduction, as opposed to a two-participant system, plays a significant explanatory role with respect to the higher rate of cultural convergence that we experienced in our deep past.\par 





Indeed, our antiquarians -- our best translation of a group of social scientists comprising, in your terminology, comparative linguists, archaeologists, historians, and so forth -- have uncovered good, albeit indirect evidence supporting the perspective outlined above. As with your species, the adoption of food production was a seminal moment in our history, leading to the growth of ``urbanism'' and a rapid increase in technological innovation. Prior to this, our ancestors had spread across the continents of our world, developing distinct local cultural traditions, with physical boundaries usually demarcating the cultural boundaries between these groups. Shortly after the adoption of food production, we domesticated a beast of burden (quite unlike your horses, but serving the same functional role) that allowed more rapid movement and vastly expanded trading in material goods as well as the movement of members of our species among previously isolated locations.

This created a set of natural experiments whereby previously non-mixing groups with distinct (and locally unified) cultures came increasingly in contact. Our antiquarians have fused linguistic data with archaeological data -- for the latter, we rely heavily on stylistic differences in vessels created from highly pliable soils fired at high temperatures (similar to your pottery, which we also invented) -- to show that as these natural experiments played out there was a very rapid unification of cultures. This occurred far more rapidly than the most comparable examples from your history, although it was far more difficult for us to piece together the story since differences in atmospheric chemistry between our worlds means we cannot utilize radiocarbon dating, since is not a constant production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14 in our world. Instead, we utilize less precise and radioisotope dating techniques and largely continue to operate in the regime that some of your archaeologists identify as cultural history. That being said, seriation techniques that form the basis for (relative) dating in cultural history are more reliable in our world since culture change is more rapid.


\section*{Hyperdrive technology, the unified theory of physics, and the meaning of life}

We have, thus far, focused on the implications of a tri-parental system, from the structure of our genetic information, to the evolution of self-avoidance, emergence of gamete asymmetries, spread of sexually transmitted diseases, and social effects from marriage to cultural mixing. 

We now move on to other topics that may be of interest to humans on Earth. We will begin with a detailed description of our hyperdrive technology that allows us to travel at the speed of light, then describe the missing pieces of your understanding of the physical world, and end with the implications of the unified theory of physics on the meaning of life.

Our hyperdrive technology is based on the well-known phenomenon of...
