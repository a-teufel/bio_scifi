There is little evidence on earth that polygyny is harmful for individuals. In societies where monogamy and polygyny occur, polygynous groups lead to greater child and woman health and security. Generally speaking, polygynous households are correlated with greater wealth; whether on earth this is due to the fact that wealthier men can have more wives, or those with more wives can aggrandize, is unclear. However, the “polygyny-threshold model” suggests that polygyny will develop when costs associated with sharing a husband can be offset by resource accumulation that would be difficult under monogamy (Lawson et al. 2015, PNAS). What is clear from these studies is that \textit{there is little evidence} that a three-parent group would lead to a decrease in child, mother, or father health. Rather, it seems that evidence points to higher health indices for each individual in this type of family on your own planet.
