Under this reasonable assumption (Mayr, 1970) the average fitness of a sexual population, without linkage between the loci, is higher, and the average equilibrium number of harmful mutations per individual lower, than in an asexual population. If a gamete contains on the average one or more new mutations, the resulting advantage of sexual reproduction and recombination seems to be sufficient to counterbalance the double advantage ofparthenogenesis. Moreover, selection against harmful mutations is probably the most powerful factor preventing linkage disequilibrium even with epistatic interaction between the loci.},

Changes in the environment stimulate adaptation but not all changes are equivalent; a change may occur along one or multiple environmental dimensions. In two evolution experiments with the facultatively sexual rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, we test how environmental complexity affects the evolution of sex by adapting replicate populations to various environments that differ from the original along one, two, or three environmental dimensions. Three different estimates of fitness (growth, lifetime reproduction, and population density) confirmed that populations adapted to their new environment. Growth measures revealed an intriguing cost of complex adaptations: populations that adapted to more complex environments lost greater amounts of fitness in the original environment. Furthermore, both experiments showed that B. calyciflorus became more sexual when adapting to a greater number of environmental dimensions. Common garden experiments confirmed that observed changes in sex were heritable. As environments in nature are inherently complex these findings help explain why sex is maintained in natural populations.},

	abstract = {Polygynous marriage is commonly regarded as a harmful cultural practice, detrimental to women and children at the individual and group level. We present counterevidence that polygyny is often positively associated with food security and child health within communities and that, although polygyny and health are negatively associated at the group level, such differences are accounted for by alternative socioecological factors. These results support models of polygyny based on female choice and suggest that, in some contexts, prohibiting polygyny could be costly for women and children by restricting marital options. Our study highlights the dangers of naive analyses of aggregated population data and the importance of considering locally realizable alternatives and context dependency when considering the health implications of cultural practices.Polygyny is cross-culturally common and a topic of considerable academic and policy interest, often deemed a harmful cultural practice serving the interests of men contrary to those of women and children. Supporting this view, large-scale studies of national African demographic surveys consistently demonstrate that poor child health outcomes are concentrated in polygynous households. Negative population-level associations between polygyny and well-being have also been reported, consistent with the hypothesis that modern transitions to socially imposed monogamy are driven by cultural group selection. We challenge the consensus view that polygyny is harmful, drawing on multilevel data from 56 ethnically diverse Tanzanian villages. We first demonstrate the vulnerability of aggregated data to confounding between ecological and individual determinants of health; while across villages polygyny is associated with poor child health and low food security, such relationships are absent or reversed within villages, particularly when children and fathers are coresident. We then provide data indicating that the costs of sharing a husband are offset by greater wealth (land and livestock) of polygynous households. These results are consistent with models of polygyny based on female choice. Finally, we show that village-level negative associations between polygyny prevalence, food security, and child health are fully accounted for by underlying differences in ecological vulnerability (rainfall) and socioeconomic marginalization (access to education). We highlight the need for improved, culturally sensitive measurement tools and appropriate scales of analysis in studies of polygyny and other purportedly harmful practices and discuss the relevance of our results to theoretical accounts of marriage and contemporary population policy.},

    abstract="In contrast to studies of birds, in mammals there is no clear evidence that polygyny evolved through female choice for males with high quality resources. Among the Kipsigis people of Kenya, polygyny may be a consequence of women's preferences for wealthy men, because strong correlations exist between land ownership and the number of a man's wives (Borgerhoff Mulder 1987 a), and the resources men hold are primary determinants of women's reproductive success (Borgerhoff Mulder 1987b). This paper has two aims: first, to test whether Kipsigis women prefer wealthy men by examining the sequence of marriages among a group of pioneers (Table 1) who established a settlement in the territory of their enemies (1930--1949); second, to determine whether women suffer reproductively as a result of polygynous marriage. Data show that Kipsigis women, or their parents on their behalf, preferentially chose men offering high quality breeding opportunities, with respect to the number of acres available on which to settle (Fig. 2) ; controlling for quality of breeding opportunity there is a preference for bachelors over monogamists over polygynists. Analyses of the full demographic sample show that there are reproductive costs associated with having a large number of cowives (Table 2), costs which women attempt to minimize through judicous marital choices. These results are discussed in relation to resource defence polgyny, female choice and, specifically, the polygyny threshold model.",

    abstract="We analyzed data that were collected continuously between 1950 and 1974 from a rural area of the Gambia to determine the effects of kin on child mortality. Multilevel event-history models were used to demonstrate that having a living mother, maternal grandmother, or elder sisters had a significant positive effect on the survival probabilities of children, whereas having a living father, paternal grandmother, grandfather, or elder brothers had no effect. The mother's remarriage to a new husband had a detrimental effect on child survival, but there was little difference in the mortality rates of children who were born to monogamous or polygynous fathers. The implications of these results for understanding the evolution of human life-history are discussed.",
