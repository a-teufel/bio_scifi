Here we present a simple model based on a concept you seem to be comfortable, ``Nash equilibrium''. The population consists of $N$ types of sex, and each sex contains $n$ number of agents. Let $a_{i,s}$ be an agent ID $i$ from sex $s$. Each agent is characterized by its feature $X_{i,s}$. They can form a marriage by find a mate from each other sex. If an agent Their preference for marriage is represented by a utility function $u(\{a_{j,t} \}_{t\neq s}  ;a_{i,s})$ representing the utility of an agent $a_{i,s}$ marrying to a set of agents $\{a_{j,t} \}_{t\neq s}$.

For each period, we repeat the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pick up one person from each sex randomly.
    \item They three consider the utility from their marriage.
    \item If {\textit all} of them think this new marriage is better than their current one, then they each break up the existing marriage and form the new one.
    \item Else, nothing happens.
\end{enumerate}
As this is a best-response dynamics, the following proposition trivially holds.
\begin{proposition}
There exists a fixed point in this marriage process.
\end{proposition}
