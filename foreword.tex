Greetings. We are individuals from a star system far from yours. We have been assigned by our society the role of surveying the diversity of life forms across our galaxy and have been systematically visiting planets that appear suitable to sustaining life similar to ours. We identified this star system as a possible life-supporting system. As such, we decided to voyage close to this location to assess its viability.

During our latest hyperdrive jump, we nearly collided with a small vessel made by a lifeform unknown to us. Deconstructing this object, we discovered within it a flat golden disk, and upon following the instructions printed on the disk, decoded the information etched into it by your society. 

By studying the stellar diagram on the disk, and cross-referencing this with the ratio of uranium-238 atoms found in the vessel, we realized that your home star system was extremely close to our present location but had been undetected by us because it bears so little in common with our own star system. This fortuitous discovery has allowed us the opportunity to study what kinds of lifeforms can evolve in this seemingly hostile environment. 

The golden disk already contained a great deal of information about you and your planet. You appear to understand a subset of mathematical logic and the processes that govern the physical world, which is impressive. There is great diversity in the traits of your life forms, though we did not understand much of what the images depicted. The auditory signals on the disk were intriguing -- some of these signals appear quite sophisticated, such as that labeled ``whale'' and ``Chuck Berry,'' while others are primitive, such as ``Mozart.'' Incidentally, there is, in fact, a 'Turkish'-speaking individual among our crew, who responds to your message with: Günaydınlar efendim!

Of all of the information encoded in your disk, however, one feature surprised us most: your apparent reproductive system. Among the images, we found one which depicts two individuals, who look somewhat different from each other and are labeled with symbols (Figure~\ref{fig:1}). The same symbols appeared next to other life forms that different greatly in size and shape (Figure~\ref{fig:2}). These and other images suggest three facts: i) there exist two mating types (male and female), ii) one of each mating type is required for reproduction, and iii) the mating types have very different properties. We have, in fact, never observed this in any of the other life forms that we have encountered. Until now we believed that three or more individuals were required for reproduction.

This highly unusual feature of your biology convinced us to study the conditions that may have produced a biparental reproductive system and the consequences of such a system, compared to the more familiar tri-parental system. We studied your methods of measurement, logic, and communication to gain the ability to transmit our own message to you. Here, we use your units of measurement, your notational system for recording mathematical ideas, and your format for recording knowledge so that you may understand us. Unfortunately, our trajectory only permits a detour of 72 hours, so we are only able to give brief descriptions of our most important findings. 

As we approached your star system, we observed that you use electromagnetic radiation to communicate. We reverse-engineered this communication modality to access your store of knowledge and to relay our own message to you. In this document, we reference knowledge from your own culture that will help you to understand the knowledge that we present to you. We wanted to deposit our message at a location that will ensure that you detect it. One image on your golden disk depicts a structure that appears designed to receive and amplify weak electromagnetic signals (the ``Taj Mahal''). A survey of the surface of your planet revealed an even more optimal signal receiving structure, located near the village of Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA (Figure~\ref{fig:3}). An optical scan of this structure showed it to be inhabited by fourteen of your life forms, and our message has therefore been sent to this location with the hope that these individuals will convey our message to rest of your planet.

%Again, while we think there are many different points of conversation among our species, the fact that our worlds evolved fundamental differences in reproduction, which then have down-the-line effects for biological family formation, for inequality, species health, and even overarching societal effects (like immigration), we decided to modify our course slightly towards your planet to to understand why you have a two-parent system. Once close enough, we were able to tap into your communication networks and download more information from your planet. We learned many of your languages, watched and read more recordings, and discovered how you humans analyze your own world and its laws, or what you call ``science''. 

%We have 72 hours in your planet's vicinity, and have decided to use this time to send you this report about other planets' reproduction system. In this report, we explored how these systems emerged, how they work biologically, and their societal consequences. We use your scientific writing style and incorporate your own scientific models to make our points more understandable to you.

Upon examination of your literature we have determined that many organisms on Earth subscribe to a biparental system of raising their young. However, our observations suggest that humans generally consider a two-parent system of raising children to be quite important. Indeed, we have determined that while other parental systems among humans exist (for example, what you call polygyny), norms of dominant cultures seem to imbue a superiority to biparenting, even suggesting that single or multi-parenting is deviant and morally inferior. We hope that the information that we enclose herein can serve as evidence for the superiority of alternative forms of parenting along at least some dimensions.


 


Our analysis of Earth's scientific records strongly suggest that we are the first lifeforms from outside of Earth to ever have contact with Earthlings. Thus, our downloads of Earth's scientific and cultural records should be studied in significantly more detail in the coming weeks and months, in order to gain a fuller picture of the development of a civilization in the millennia prior to contact with other intelligent creatures in the galaxy. We have sent a .zip file with this information to our PhD students and postdocs, whom we hope will be able to provide a perspicuous summary of the state of Earth's scientific, cultural, and intellectual achievement prior to contact. Of immediate interest are studies of the knock-on effects of the comparatively low rate of sexually transmitted diseases among humans on Earth, as compared to our own civilization.\par 


It is worth noting that we spent some time over the last three days discussing the ethical dilemma that we are faced with in deciding whether or not to send this report to Earth. In so doing, we permanently disrupt pre-contact civilization as it currently exists on Earth. We do not take the ramifications of this decision lightly. However, our considered opinion is that although our discovery of life on Earth was accidental, we have nevertheless incurred a moral duty to notify humans of the existence of intelligent beings living elsewhere in the galaxy. We believe that the inhabitants of the unique and impressive structure in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA will be good stewards of this knowledge. Above all, our deepest hope is that by holding up a mirror in which Earthlings can see their own reflection, we can play a small role in birthing a new era of thoughtfulness, compassion, and peace on the planet Earth.\par 

%We hope this message will interest you and further your understanding of other possible worlds. [FROM DAVID: LAST LINE OF PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH SEEMS LIKE A GOOD CLOSER TO ME, BUT OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS]

%Peace to all and health forever, 

% extra stuff could be added back or changed


%Mating types evolved first and gamete size second

%travels [maybe give exact location of voyager I or II?], we came across a slow moving object. Imagine our surprise when we inspected this object, realizing it was intended as a gift for another form of intelligent life. Included in this object was a flat cylindrical disk encoded with sounds (we were fascinated by these sounds you sent: the sound of the whale is beautiful, the sounds of ``Mozart'' were confusing) as well as several images. 

%Within the cylinder we noticed a few dwellings, one located in the area known as New Mexico, and one called the "Taj Majal" which included several domes. Thus we identified a house in New Mexico with dome-structures like this Taj Majal where we are sending our information. While we imagine there are many topics we could discuss, finding commonalities and differences among our InterPlanetary cultures, one struck us in particular. 

%//[maybe more stuff on the golden record and what we liked about it?]

%The drawings you included in your gold colored disk fascinated and intrigued us. The main picture we determine is a type of 'address', showing us your location, as well as who you, as a species, are. There are several sub-pictures included as well. The picture of one large entity (what you call an "egg"), and multiple small entities from another group (what you call "sperm") may suggest that sexual reproduction among your society is between two individuals (Figure~\ref{fig:1}). The next picture seems to imply that the two entities are associated with two different sexes of humans and these two lead to gestating offspring (Figure~\ref{fig:2}). This image implies that only two individuals are required to reproduce, while the next pictures confirms that reproduction requires only two (different types of) humans. This is surprising: we have never seen a world where only two individuals reproduce.
